# Abstract

This report will replicate the main results displayed in section 3.2 **Multiple Linear Regression** (chapter 3) of the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*.

# Introduction

The primary goal of this analysis is to give advice on how to boost sales of the  product given the current information on advetising budgets. More specifically, the idea is to determine whether there exists an correalation between advertising and sales, and if so, formulate an accurate model that can be used to predict sales from media budget. For this analysis in particular, a combination of simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.

# Data

The Advertising data set comprises of the Sales (in thousands of units) in 200 different markets, along with the advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars)  in each market for three different forms of media: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. In this report, the relation between each of them and Sales, and the possible relation between Sales and the three of them combined are observed and studied/analyzed.

We may first look at the table of summary statistics below:

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
advert <- read.csv('http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv')
library(xtable)
print(xtable(summary(advert[2:5]), caption = "Summary Statistics"), comment = FALSE)
```

Histograms for each variable:

# Methodology

## Single Linear Regression

We consider each media separately from the data set - TV, Radio and Newspaper - and study its relationship with the dependent variable Sales. The null hypothesis is that each of the independent variables would not have an effect on Sales, and the alternate hypothesis suggests otherwise. Thus a linear model is generated:

$$Sales = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} (TV | Radio | Newspaper)$$

## Multiple Linear Regression

It would be a better approach to expand the model of Sales with multiple predictors rather than single predictors each time, avoiding an excess of linear models. This is done by accomodating each predictor with their respective slope coefficient in a single model. Thus the multiple linear regression model takes the form:

$$Sales = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}TV + \beta_{2}Radio + \beta_{3}Newspaper$$

# Results 

## Single Linear Regression

Using `lm()` to fit the data into a simple linear model, the regression coefficients are as follows:

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
advert <- read.csv('http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv')
library(xtable)
print(xtable(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$TV), caption = "Regression Coefficents for TV~Sales"), comment = FALSE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
advert <- read.csv('http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv')
library(xtable)
print(xtable(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Radio), caption = "Regression Coefficents for TV~Radio"), comment = FALSE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
advert <- read.csv('http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv')
library(xtable)
print(xtable(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Newspaper), caption = "Regression Coefficents for TV~Newspaper"), comment = FALSE)
```

The scatterplots with their respective regression lines are as follows:

![Figure 5: Scatterplot for Sales and TV](../images/scatterplot-tv-sales.png)
![Figure 6: Scatterplot for Sales and Radio](../images/scatterplot-radio-sales.png)
![Figure 7: Scatterplot for Sales and Newspaper](../images/scatterplot-newspaper-sales.png)

Quality Indices calculated with the regression analysis are as follows:

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
source('../code/functions/regression-functions.R')
TV.Table = matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
Quantity = c("RSE", "R^2", "F-statistic")
TV.Value = c(residual_std_error(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$TV)), r_squared(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$TV)), f_statistic(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$TV)))
TV.Table[,1] = Quantity
TV.Table[,2] = TV.Value
colnames(TV.Table) = c('Quantity', 'Value')
print(xtable(TV.Table, caption = "Quality Indices of Regression of Sales and TV"), comment = FALSE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
source('../code/functions/regression-functions.R')
Radio.Table = matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
Quantity = c("RSE", "R^2", "F-statistic")
Radio.Value = c(residual_std_error(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Radio)), r_squared(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Radio)), f_statistic(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Radio)))
Radio.Table[,1] = Quantity
Radio.Table[,2] = Radio.Value
colnames(Radio.Table) = c('Quantity', 'Value')
print(xtable(Radio.Table, caption = "Quality Indices of Regression of Sales and Radio"), comment = FALSE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='asis',message=FALSE}
source('../code/functions/regression-functions.R')
News.Table = matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
Quantity = c("RSE", "R^2", "F-statistic")
News.Value = c(residual_std_error(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Newspaper)), r_squared(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Newspaper)), f_statistic(lm(advert$Sales ~ advert$Newspaper)))
News.Table[,1] = Quantity
News.Table[,2] = News.Value
colnames(TV.Table) = c('Quantity', 'Value')
print(xtable(News.Table, caption = "Quality Indices of Regression of Sales and Newspaper"), comment = FALSE)
```

## Multiple Regression Analysis


# Conclusions

In conclusion, the multiple linear regression is more accurate than the single linear regressions. From the tables above (`F-statistic`) from multiple regression, at the very least one of the predictors can be used to predict `Sales`. Nevertheless, we also find that not all of the predictors are statistically significant (from the p-values). Hence, the prediction would be more accurate if the `newspaper` budget is not avoided based on its corresponding p-value. Other indicators including Residual Standarnd Error, R^{2} and F-statistic also comment on the fit of the linear model - the smaller these vaules/statistics or approaching 0, the more accurately the model represents the data.
